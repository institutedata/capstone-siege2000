# REACT

</div>

</br>

## Objective


### *Create a dynamic and interactive frontend Application that uses the core principles of React.*

Create an **interactive** page/s of their choice using React. Ideally the app will include interactive elements such as forms, links and buttons, along with routes, data fetching and various React hooks as needed, as well as external libraries such as [bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/docs/getting-started/introduction), [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app) and [MUI](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/docs/getting-started/introduction). 

<br>

## Design Steps:

1. Decide on what you work on
2. Write down your objectives in the file *objectives.md* , in the root directory of this repository.

- Optional: Draw a wireframe of your app
- Optional: List of [FREE APIs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15iDpjqyBkSse9wcN7vvQvORBvX8P_ivAjm-iKXp776Y/edit#gid=0) to integrate.

<br>

(Inside the repo)

       1. `npx create-next-app@latest` 
       2.  When asked..
              - to provide a name for your mini project: **Yes**, *(e.g. mini-project-2)*
